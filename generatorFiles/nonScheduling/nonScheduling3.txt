Hey Yllias,

I was just wondering where to find the corpus for the scheduling?

Do we make one? The Enron dataset that I used for the previous assignment has spam/no spam emails, but I can't seem to find any dataset online for email scheduling.  I don't think there is one from nltk's corpora either!

Thanks a bunch,

Adam
